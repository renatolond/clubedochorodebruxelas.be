Founded in 2016, the *Clube* was born out of a desire to share and introduce Choro music across as many people as possible.\\
This lively, sparkling, catchy music is an invitation to be cheerful. It is impossible to resist its syncopated rhythms... from finger snapping to hip swaying, everyone is naturally drawn in!\\
Each *Roda* is an opportunity for the audience and musicians to come together in a moment of sharing and joy. But Choro, which means ‘crying’ in Portuguese, can also provoke profound emotions.\\
Although it was the first urban instrumental music in Brazil, providing the basis for Samba and then Bossa, Choro remains unknown to many people.

When the club was launched, its activities mainly consisted of organising concerts in collaboration with Brazilian musicians on European tour. These concerts were an opportunity to introduce this original style of music, which turned out to be a great success with the public.

The uniqueness of this music lies in its improvisational nature and the freedom it offers to its various musicians. All this is done in a spirit of camaraderie, exchange and playfulness.\\
This characteristic of Choro, combining humour, variety and playing collectively to syncopated rhythms, aroused the curiosity of the public and inspired the desire to create a space, a meeting place designed to promote the knowledge and development of this technique.\\
Like Choro itself, the Clube thrives on the diversity of the people it welcomes.\\
The idea is not to claim the excellence of Brazilian Choro Clubs, but at our level, to offer a place for exchange, learning and practice of this music.\\
It is a place that welcomes everyone, from amateur practitioners in search of new experiences to renowned musicians in the field who are always ready to share their knowledge.\\
To this end, the Clube's activities are organised around learning workshops and public performances.
