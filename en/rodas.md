Come and join us for a unique musical moment!

Come and meet the Choro, the first Brazilian instrumental music, at the crossroads of European, African and indigenous cultures, which gathers unrivalled melodic, harmonic and rhythmic richness!

Gathered around a table, the musicians perform a constantly reinvented repertoire and the audience is drawn into this festive atmosphere!

Conviviality, joy, sharing... You are all welcome!

Choro workshops participants will find a unique way to practice together the themes studied.
