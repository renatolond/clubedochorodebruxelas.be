The _Roda_ is a combination of a repertory, musicians and the unexpected results of the collective game.

The Roda is the improvisation, as much in the organisation as it is in the way it unfolds:\\
First, a table around which the musicians are gathered.

Then, the musicians, composed of a base combination of one or two guitars, a _cavaquinho_ for the accompaniment, a _pandeiro_ for the rhythms and one or two soloist instruments.

This essential group will welcome any extra musicians.

The particularity of a Roda resides in the fact that one never knows ahead of time the Roda's exact composition. Nor does one know exactly which songs will be played.

In the Roda, everything is collaboration.

The _chorões_ that are present will, in turn, start songs as the mood takes them.

The soloists share the melody, each interpreting the theme on their turn.

Together, the other musicians, becoming accompanists, adapt to the proposed interpretation. A game of glances, teasing, surprises between musicians is what completes this moment of expression.

Given its form, each Roda is unique. The spontaneity of the musical propositions, the diversity of the influences, the diversity of the participants, all of them contribute to the richess of this formation. A cultural, social and generational mix, everyone meets for a moment of shared pleasure.

The Roda is the ideal occasion to practice what is learned in the workshops. Everyone can find their place, no matter what their pratice level is. Every musician is welcome and integrated into the collective, the learning is done by contact with others.

Supported in their initiatives, progressively even the most shy gain confidence.
