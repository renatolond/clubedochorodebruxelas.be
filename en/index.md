**Originally from Brazil**, *Choro* is born of the **unexpected encounter between two very different worlds**: the music of European ballroom dance from the 19th century (Polca, Valsa, Scottish...) and African rhythms (Batuque, Lundu...)

The *Clube* is born from the desire of introducing, and sharing, Choro to the largest number of people possible.

For this purpose, the activities of the Clube are organised around learning workshops and public presentations.

The **weekly workshops** are **aimed at all musicians**, beginners or advanced, professionals or amateurs. Everyone can find their place in the Choro practice. [Click here to know more about the workshops](/workshops).

The *Roda* is a combination of a repertory, musicians and the unexpected results of the collective game. The Roda is the ideal occasion to practice what is learned in the workshops. Everyone can find their place, no matter what their practice level is. Every musician is welcome and integrated into the collective, learning is done by contact with others. [Click here to know more about the Rodas](/rodas).

The Clube proposes **masterclasses**. They are led by **musicians specialised in Choro** that come to present their story, their vision and key tips for the practice. [Click here to know more about the masterclasses](/masterclasses).

For everyone to enjoy, **concerts** are organised, sometimes with the musicians who give the masterclasses, in various venues.
