**Original from Brazil**, the *Choro* is born of the **unexpected encounter between two very different worlds**: The music of european balroom dance from the 19th century (Polca, Valsa, Scottisch...) and the african rhythms (Batuque, Lundu...)

The *Clube* is born from the desire of introducing and sharing the Choro to the largest number of people possible.

For this purpose, the activities of the Clube are organized around learning workshops and public presentations.

The **weekly workshops** are **aimed at all musicians**, beginners or advanced, professional or amateurs. Everyone can find their place in the Choro practice. [Click here to know more about the workshops](/workshops).

The *Roda* is the meeting of a repertory, musicians and the unexpected of the collective game. The Roda is the ideal occasion to practice what is learned in the workshops. Everyone can find their place, no matter what is their pratice level. Every musician are welcome and integrated to the collective, the learning is done by the contact with others.

With the objective of explore in depth the knowledge of the Choro universe, the tradition of the Clube is to open its doors monthly to a **special guest**.

In this ocasion, the Clube proposes a **masterclass** led by a **musician specialized in the Choro** that comes to present their story, their vision and key tips for the pratice.

Finally, it is completed by a **concert** which will be the ocasion for the invited musician to present their repertory and their compositions. They are accompanied by the Clube teachers.
