The workshops are aimed at all musicians, beginners or experienced, professionals and amateurs. Everyone can find their place in the Choro practice.\\
By being organized in different levels, the workshops are adapted to the profiles of the people present and their talents.

For the beginners, it starts by the discovery of the main bases of the Choro:

 - The rhythmic patterns used in the Choro are broekn down and analyzed by all participants with the help of percussion instruments or exercises of body percussion.
 - The structure of the songs are studied (rondo form), as well as the tonality changes that reocurr between different parts and the _levadas_ to start each solo...
 - The work on the subtleties contributes to highlight the group's dynamic by focusing on how each musician tells their own story by the choices of their interpretation.
 - The accompaniment is also studied trough the work of the typical figures, as well as the harmonies.
 - The pratice is split between the study of sheet music and listening of recordings, which allows the participants to move without necessarily mastering sight reading.
 - No need to be a virtuoso, whichever instrument and level of mastering, everyone can participate on their level to the construction of this musical journey.

To the more advanced, the objective of the workshops is to show the technique and language of the Choro.

  - The improvisation is quite specific in the Choro. It is done by variations on top of the theme. It can also be complemented by the proposal of countermelodies made by other musicians. It is expressed by a game of questions and answers, of different nuances.
  - The participants start by studying with precision the melody and the harmony of the theme so they can improvise variations that match the identify of the song.
  - For this purpose, it is proposed a pallete of musical processes, such as rhythmic shifts, repetitions, references, parallel voices, oppositions, changes on the rhythmic cells...
  - The different accompanying instruments learn to enrich the harmony by adapting the chord inversions, adding passing chords or substitution.

The instrument practice is the base for the workshops. The theoretical principles introduced, the reference recordings listened come to enrich the musical palette or to answer to specific questions brought by the participants.
