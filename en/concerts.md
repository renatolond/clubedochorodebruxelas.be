On certain occasions, such as after a Masterclass, during an important event, or to introduce Choro to a new segment of society, the musicians of Clube do Choro get together to perform.

In the case of a Masterclass, the Club's teachers join the guest musician to play their repertoire and great Choro classics.

On other occasions, the Club's teachers get together with other musicians and perform great Choro classics.

For the audience, it is a pleasure to see classics reinterpreted by great musicians, and for workshop participants, it is an opportunity to study the interpretation of Choros that they may not yet be familiar with.

Often, at the end of the show, those present are invited to participate in a small Roda.
