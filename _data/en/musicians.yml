  bio: |-
    Originally trained in classical music, Sylvain has had a very eclectic career.\\
    He studied in France at the Tarbes Conservatory and the Toulouse Conservatory from 1987 to 1999. He quickly became interested in extended techniques on the flute (multiphonics, flute and voice, percussive sounds, etc.) and musical improvisation.\\
    He also plays the C flute, alto flute, bass flute, piccolo and pifano (traditional Brazilian bamboo flute).\\
    Always keen to try new experiences, he diversified his practice by playing in various groups alongside Gnawa musicians (Morocco), in a forró group and in a Son Jarocho group (traditional Mexican music from Vera Cruz).\\
    Keen to make music accessible to all, he teaches music as a private tutor and also at a specialist institution for children (IRSA).

    It was his encounter with the world of the famous Hermeto Pascoal (Brazilian multi-instrumentalist and composer) that sparked his passion for Brazilian music. This led him to travel to Brazil many times, where he had the opportunity to train with renowned musicians such as Antonio Rocha, Eduardo Neves, Itiberê Zwarg...\\
    In 2016, he founded the Clube de Choro de Bruxelas with Brazilian bassist Everton Rodrigues with the aim of sharing his passion.

  bio: |-
    With a Master's degree in jazz guitar (2013), Matteo trained at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels under Fabien Degryse and Victor Da Costa.\\
    Already fascinated by João Gilberto's guitar playing and magical voice, he discovered the sambas of Cartola and Nelson Cavaquinho thanks to Victor Da Costa (Brazilian), whose rhythms and sounds (especially the 7-string guitar playing) instantly captivated him. During the summer of 2012, he discovered another style of Brazilian music, Choro.\\
    Fascinated by this new style, he undertook several study trips to Brazil (2013, 2016 and 2019), where he learned to play the cavaquinho (a small 4-string guitar typical of choro and samba) and discovered the breadth and depth of the world of Brazilian guitar.\\
    Alongside his activities as a professional musician (jazz, Brazilian music, Neapolitan song), he also teaches, both in public institutions (academies) and associations (Clube do Choro de Bruxelas) and as a private tutor.
